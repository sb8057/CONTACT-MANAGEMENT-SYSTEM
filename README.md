  The GUI includes Firstname, Lastname, Gender, Age, Address and Contact all of these are created using Tkinter that is already pre-installed in python library. Some of the components that we used are Label, text field, radio button, buttons etc. This is a user friendly graphical interface where user can easily fill their details and complaints. Clicking on ‘Save’ button contact will be saved, as you can see from the below image.
    
After clicking on ‘Save’ button the contact will be stored in the connected database.
  This is how our Contact Management System effectively addresses user requirements by providing a seamless platform for users to submit their concerns and complaints. Simultaneously, the organization gains the ability to access and review these complaints stored in the database. This project operates on a unidirectional communication model, enabling users to interact with the organization through the submission of complaints, while the organization, in turn, can efficiently manage and respond to these concerns.
